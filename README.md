MinFetch is meant to be an easily customisable and clean fetch.
As is the UNIXâ„¢ "fuck bloat" "if you have more than 2 packages
you don't deserve computers" way it doesn't have a config file,
instead you edit the code yourself (dw its dead easy, and you can
shoot me an email if you need help lmao). It also has multiple
different switches to control its output out of the box.

## Installation

Download the script and make it executable (optionally do this in a folder thats on your PATH so you can execute the script from anywhere)

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xXTacticalWaffleXx/minfetch/main/minfetch > minfetch && chmod +x ./minfetch
```

## Switches

-a is used to add ascii art for your distro of choice

-o adds an OwO graphic where the distro ascii goes

-p sets the packages to the 32-bit signed integer limit

-d is a debug flag that normally does nothing

-u adds a unix time field if you want one for some reason

-h prints a help message

-e enables experimental code, in this case fedora and gentoo package counts
